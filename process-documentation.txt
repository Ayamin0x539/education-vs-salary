Project Outline:
Idea: Map college costs to salaries by region and profession.
Goals:
Determine why people move out of state for work. (Ties in with CT skills challenge goal.)
Improve education in colleges or suggest more affordable college prices.

Process Documentation:
Decided to use Wolfram API.
Fiddled with Java library, but too many dependencies
Format:

http://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query?input=<USER_STRING>&appid=<APP_ID> 

Example:
http://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query?input=salary+mathematician+physicist++chemist+in+connecticut&appid=3L7PJ5-47TTGPVWT2

User input
Location
Profession
University (optional)
Output:
Cost of attendance at university if specified, otherwise of all universities in the state
Pinpointed on Google Maps using Google Maps API

What we do with user input:
1. Run the query: “average salary in ${CITY} for ${PROFESSION}”
Plaintext output is in the format
art directors | 40 people  (100%) | $72030 per year
computer programmers | 480 people | $72260 per year
2. Run The query: “college tuition for ${COLLEGE_NAME}”
See sample output.


Example output for salary:
Related occupations
------------
 | people employed | mean wage
computer programmers | 480 people | $72260 per year
computer software engineers |  | 
computer support specialists | 840 people | $52330 per year
computer systems analysts | 840 people | $77870 per year
database administrators | 170 people | $81310 per year
network and computer systems administrators | 610 people | $67780 per year
network systems and data communications analysts | 730 people | $74350 per year
miscellaneous computer specialists | 80 people | $68130 per year

Plan:
Parse until we see “Related occupations”, skip the line with “------------”, then call Java’s String.split method using “ | “ as the token for delimiting. Skip the rest once we see an empty line.

...

Example output for tuition cost:
Result
------------
$7632 per year  (US dollars per year)

Plan:
Parse until we see “Result”, skip the line with “------------”, then use Java’s nextInt() method on the input stream to pull the dollar mount.
